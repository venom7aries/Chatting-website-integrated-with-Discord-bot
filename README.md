# Chatting-website-integrated-with-Discord-bot
 This is the first ever Chatting website integration with a Discord bot.

1. Basically all i did was to create a frontend and a backend server to hold the website all together.

2. First half of the server.js contains the backend server and the other half of it contains the Discord.js code.

If theres an issue, contact me at:
Discord: Tac Shadow#5920
Server: https://dsc.gg/tacticalshadow

Im currently experimenting my discord bot with integration with IBM Watson, Google, Socket and Tensorflow
My dm is open for feature request and bug issue report and maybe even for a friendly good morning :]
